    "I used the basic `<len>` and `<.shape>` command to calculate summary statistics of the traffic\n",

    "Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. The firt image is the view of some random images in the datasets.\n",

    "### Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Pre-process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to remove some images, since there is too much dupulicate image for each class. I choose a threshold at 1000 images, since I think the same picture may leads to a bad result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of samples in each class:  \n",
    " [ 180 1980 2010 1260 1770 1650  360 1290 1260 1320 1800 1170 1890 1920  690\n",

    "  390  690  210  599  360 1080  330  180 1860  270  300  210  210]\n",
    "  \n",
    "![Barchart1](./ref/Barchart2.png \"Barchart2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I convert the images to grayscale because it has less image depth, it may help for keep the image information meanwhile shorten the time consumption in building neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step, I normalized the image data because the original image has different contrast due to the frame was take under various daylight envioment, which is really bad for a high quality nueral network construction. At first, I try to simulate the trick taken in *Multi-Column Deep Neural Network for Traffic Sign\n",
    "Classification*, which contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Image Adjustment (Imadjust) MATLAB\n",
    "* Histogram Equalization (Histeq) MATLAB\n",
    "* Adaptive Histogram Equalization\n",
    "* Contrast Normalization (Conorm)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above technique, most of them were come from MATLAB, and I try to simulate the same function in python(I do quite a lot search ) however I failed. I know the main purpose is trying to take the sample image more clear or dark picture lighter. Above all, I move back to the basic normalize process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I made a `<shuffle>` in sklearn package to the dataset since the images in same class seems locate in very close position.\n",
